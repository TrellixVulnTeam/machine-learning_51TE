# machine-learning

This repository contains several IPython Notebooks covering various machine learning models and examples for learning purposes. I have created these projects by following certain online sources listed below.

## Projects

```
k-nearest-neighbors.ipynb
```
K Nearest Neighbors Classifier example

```
naive-bayes.ipynb
```
Naive Bayes Classifier example
