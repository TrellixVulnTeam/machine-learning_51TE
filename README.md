# machine-learning

This repository contains several IPython Notebooks covering various machine learning models and examples for learning purposes. I have created these projects by following certain online sources listed below.

## Projects

```

```
K Nearest Neighbors Classifier example

```
naive-bayes.ipynb
```
Naive Bayes Classifier example

```
linear-regression.ipynb
```
Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm

```
logistic-regression.ipynb
```
Logistic Regression Algorithm

```
newsgroups-datasets-analysis.ipynb
```
Creates a Bag of Words representation of text document features to use for Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers. The classifiers are trained to determine the category of new documents
